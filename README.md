Problem:
Modern research papers are too numerous, too long, and too interconnected for humans to reason over manually.
What researchers actually want:
1. “What should I read first?”
2. “What are the main approaches?”
3. “Which papers are foundational vs incremental?”
4. “How does this paper fit into the field?”
5. “Why is this relevant to my question?”

Google Scholar is good at:
Finding papers by keyword
Counting citations
But there are still gaps and cons that google scholar lacks \
-> Explaining why papers matter \
-> Grouping papers conceptually 

-> Answering natural-language questions \
-> Showing relationships between ideas 

**Research intelligence = structure + reasoning** \
Graph RAG system can address these gaps, it builds structure first, then answers questions using that structure.

It uses 3 types of intelligence system 1. Semantic Intelligence 2.Knowledge graphs 3. Citation Intelligence
